# Intermediate Twitter skills

Here are a few ways that you can lift your Twitter game now that you've got some experience under your belt.

## Pinning a tweet to your profile

Once you've got more than about twenty tweets, you should 'pin' one of these tweets to the top of you profile. A pinned tweet will be the first tweet that someone sees when they visit your profile, so use this wisely. Here are some ideas of the types of tweets you should consider pinning to your profile:

- Your latest paper
- Your most important paper
- Information about an upcoming talk
- A summary of your current research project
- An announcement for research participant recruitment

As for me, I tend to choose what is currently my most important paper. Pinned tweets continue to get likes and retweets long after you originally post them.

## Bookmarking tweets

While some people like tweets as way to bookmark them for later use, Twitter has a specific bookmarking feature. Just click on the share button under a tweet, then click on "Add Tweet to Bookmarks", as [\@_DaniBeck](https://twitter.com/_DaniBeck) demonstrates here.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ScienceTwitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ScienceTwitter</a><br><br>Don&#39;t forget the usefulness of the BOOKMARKüîñoption!<br><br>If you see someone post a good resource: bookmark it &amp; make your very own twitter depositoryüîñ<br><br>üëáüèæyou see how to bookmark &amp; an example of my bookmarks; some great resources from <a href="https://twitter.com/dsquintana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dsquintana</a>.<a href="https://twitter.com/AcademicChatter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AcademicChatter</a> <a href="https://t.co/oAOoE4XnwB">pic.twitter.com/oAOoE4XnwB</a></p>&mdash; ·¥Ö·¥Ä…¥…™  ô·¥á·¥Ñ·¥ã ‚ùº (@_DaniBeck) <a href="https://twitter.com/_DaniBeck/status/1216742537844678657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a handy feature for when you come across a tweet with a link to an interesting paper but you don't have the time now to read it that moment, for instance.

## Hashtags

These are useful for categorizing your tweets. One example of hashtag use is that they can organise communities of like-minded people. The \#PhDchat hashtag is a community of PhD students who often post questions and provide support for each other.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The people who succeed are not those who never fail. The people who succeed are those who can move past failure and keep trying.<br><br>Also, the people around you are feeling just as intimidated and insecure as you are. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhDchat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PhDchat</a> <a href="https://t.co/lly5wgo2wl">https://t.co/lly5wgo2wl</a></p>&mdash; Jen Heemstra (@jenheemstra) <a href="https://twitter.com/jenheemstra/status/1232494183140745217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Hashtags are also useful for organising tweets related to a specific event, like a conference. Many conferences now announce their 'official' hashtag that should be used for tweets related to a conference. For many conferences, there are a lot of interesting conversations happening on Twitter, so get involved and with the conference hashtag don't miss out.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2009: The REAL conference is at the bar <br><br>2019: The REAL conference is on twitter</p>&mdash; Dan Quintana (@dsquintana) <a href="https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1104301358885281792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Images

When you post your images, you can tag Twitter usernames in your images. After adding your image, click on "Tag people" (Figure \@ref(fig:tag)).

```{r tag, fig.cap='Tagging users in photos.', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tag.png')
```

Tagging photos has a few advantages. First, it saves you a few characters in your tweet as you tag people in the photo instead. Anyone that you tag will be notified that they've been included in a photo. You don't have to use this feature for tagging pictures of people. For example, you can post a screenshot of the abstract of a new paper and tag the co-authors of your paper.

## Twitter polls

If you're reading this, you're probably a scientist, so you should understand that Twitter polls are by no means scientific. However, they still provide *some* information and provide a fun alternative to typical text tweets(Fig ure \@ref(fig:poll)).

```{r poll, fig.cap='A twitter poll', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/poll.png')
```

To improve data quality, people sometimes include a "Show me the data" option. This means that people who would like to see the results but don't want to participate in the pool by giving a dummy response can select this. You can also set how long the poll should run for.

Polls can sometimes start an interesting discussion around the subject of the poll, so consider using this as a conversation starter.
