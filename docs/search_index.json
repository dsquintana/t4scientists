The lightglobe icon was created by @dcossyle and downloaded from this page. The salt shaker icon was made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com. Thanks to @grrrck for his work on the ‘tweetmd’ R package. I wrote and published this book using the bookdown R package and host the book on Github. I first learned about these tools on Twitter, of course. "]
